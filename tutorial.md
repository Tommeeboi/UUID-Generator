# UUID Tutorial
This is a clearer tutorial on how to open this generator.

WARNING: This is a tutorial for Windows, and mainly Windows 11. If you're on Windows 10, it should be very similar, and you probably don't need any extra steps. If you're on Mac, it will also be similar, but the interface will look different. I don't have macOS so I can't really help you much more than that. If you're on Linux... you're probably knowledgeable enough to work this out yourself xD

1. Download this repository. You can do this by clicking the green "Code" button, then clicking "Download ZIP"
2. Go to the folder where it saved (it's most likely in Downloads.) The file will be called "UUID-Generator-master.zip"
3. Extract/unzip the file. You can do this by right-clicking on the file and clicking "Extract All...". Then extract the folder like this:

(WARNING: Keep the path at it's default setting, unless you know exactly what you're doing)
4. Go inside the unzipped version (it's just a folder with the exact same name as the zip file apart from .zip)
5. Open the index.html file in your browser, like so:
